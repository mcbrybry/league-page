    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={zeroOne}>1.1 Decision Process</h3>
	
    <p>Each Patron Saint is chosen for how they inspire us to make bad decisions. Brady deflating footballs, Peterman throwing INTs, or Josh Gordon not being able to stay off the weed. In the playoffs each season, we'll decide who has truly embarrassed themselves and hold a league vote for the next season's face.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={one}>Section 1 Roster Breakdown</h2>
    
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneOne}>1.1 Positional Breakdown</h3>
    
    <p>14 Total Players</p>
    
    <p class="underscore">Starters</p>
    <ul>
        <li>QB</li>
        <li>RB</li>
        <li>RB</li>
        <li>WR</li>
        <li>WR</li>
        <li>TE</li>
        <li>FLEX (RB/WR/TE)</li>
        <li>D/ST</li>
        <li>K</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>5 Bench</p>

	<p>3 IR Spots (Player must be labeled as IR, Out, or Covid in the Sleeper App)</p>

    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneOneOne}>1.1.1 Keepers</h3>
	
    <p>This league incorporates 2 keepers of any position every year, with each player being allowed to be kept two times before being let go to the draft again. Any keeper will cost a pick one round higher than where they were drafted, with a minimum of a 6th. So any player drafted in the 7th or lower or picked up off waivers/FA will cost a 6th, or a 5th and 6th if you keep two from that range. Any player's draft history can be found on their player card in Sleeper.</p>

    <p>Examples: Draft D'Andre Swift in the 3rd round in 2020, he can be kept for a 2nd round pick in 2021 and a 1st round pick in 2022. Derrick Henry was drafted in the first in 2020, so he could not be kept in 2021.</p>
	
    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneTwo}>1.2 Trading</h3>
    
    <p>Trading of all players is allowed. Trades will process immediately and will be reversed if vetoed or under investigation for collusion. Tradable assets include players and FAAB $.</p>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players and FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First Offense – Warning and a new profile picture and team name to make fun of you.</li>
            <li>Second Offense – Immediate freeze on all transaction types for the next 4 weeks of regular season and playoff fantasy football games, including trades and waiver wire bids.</li>
            <li>Third Offense – Indefinite freeze on transactions while a league meeting of all members not involved in any of the improper trades/activity in question will take place to discuss next steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>*Collusion includes the organizing of veto votes against an acceptable trade.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>Any player traded from a team may be re-acquired via trade after the original trade. However a league vote will decide if it is collusion or not depending on the situation.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoThree}>1.2.3 Trade Deadline</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>The trade deadline will be set for the Saturday of the week 12 games of the NFL season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFour}>1.2.4 Trade Restrictions</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>You may only trade FAAB $ from the current season. Draft picks are not up for trade, although that can be put to a league vote in the future.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFive}>1.2.5 Veto/Trade Process</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>A total of 10 veto votes are required to veto a trade. Vetoes are only appropriate in instances of collusion or an egregious mismatch of value (i.e. CMC for a backup kicker). Not liking a trade does not warrant a veto.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    
    <h3 bind:this={oneThree}>1.3 Waiver Wire</h3>
    
    <p>FAAB Waiver wire system. Each team will begin the season with $100. $0 bids are allowed. Bids will process Wednesdays whenever Sleeper does them in the early AM.</p>

    <p>FAAB budgets will reset each season.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2 Drafting</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order each year is determined by the results of the Consolation bracket and the Playoff bracket. The winner of the consolation gets their first choice of whatever pick they want, followed by consolation runner up, then down the rankings until the champion gets the last available pick.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Draft Day Trades</h3>
    <p>Currently we do not allow trades during the draft.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3 Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote, and those votes can be called whenever for implimentation the next season.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4 Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season, the 6 teams with the best record will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. The 2 teams with the best records will receive a bye week in the first round of the playoffs. Each playoff matchup will only last one week and the winner will advance. Week 18 will not be used.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>
    <p>If two teams finish with the same record the tiebreakers will go as followed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Points For</li>
        <li>Head 2 Head Record</li>
        <li>Division Record</li>
        <li>Total Points Against</li>
        <li>Marbles</li>
        <li>See u in Smash</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. Any evidence of intentionally leaving roster spots empty in order to improve your draft position may be subject to punishment, including but not limited to the forfeiture of draft selections.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, or confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally grounds for removal.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commisiooners will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to participate and interact, and will be very active within the league.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>This league does not have any dues, it is a free league. However, the Champion every year is awarded with the traveling belt alongside a knockoff jersey from their team and a championship ring. While these aren't expensive, any help is appreciated.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Awards</h3>
    <p>As stated above, the league winner is awarded with our traveling Championship Belt, alongside a knockoff jersey of one of their players and a championship ring.
